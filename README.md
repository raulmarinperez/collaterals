## Raul Marin's technical articles
In this public Github repo I'll publish all my technical articles, and I'll share all the code I develop to help you reproduce the steps I describe.

The following are the articles available so far:

 - **[nifi/airqualitydata](nifi/airqualitydata/).-** External/legacy processes integration within NiFi. I present a NiFi project extracting air data quality of European cities from the [Air Quality In Europe](https://www.airqualitynow.eu/comparing_home.php) web site.
 
If you have any suggestion, feel free to contact me and share your thoughts.

Raul
