## Raul Marin's technical stuff
In this public Github repo I'll publish all the technical stuff I think people might be interested in. Part of the contents will be built by myself, but I'll also share stuff made by other people that I think it's good enough to be shared.

Things you can have access to from this main page:

 - **[hdf](hdf).-** Articles, artefacts, presentations, etcetera around the data in motion processing platform made by Hortonworks (Hortonworks DataFlow).
 - **[meetups](meetups/).-** Contents built for Meetup events. I'll add slides, demos' artefacts and recordings if they're available.
 - **[miscellaneous](miscellaneous).-** Might be anything (documents, recording, code, ...) that is not matching any of the other categories.
 
I'm open to feedback and suggestions to add. Feel free to touch base.

Raul
