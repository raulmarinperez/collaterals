## Knowledge
Articles, artefacts, presentations, etcetera for many different technologies I've worked with.

This is what you'll find in this folder:

 - **[hdf](hdf).-** Stuff around the data in motion processing platform made by Hortonworks (Hortonworks DataFlow).
 - **[dockerized_hadoop](dockerized_hadoop).-** Docker image definitions to build: (1) a vanilla Hadoop container and (2) Hive2+Zeppelin container; both are useful for testing, development or training purposes. Definitely, far from being production ready.
